Intro:

Think of the weather extremes during the last years. The german city DÃ¼sseldorf was plagued by a drought in 2018, Hagen was flooded in 2021. The summmers keep getting hotter.
Climate changes leads to more of those weather extremes. We all agree that climate change is a huge problem and only becoming bigger.

When we look at our own personal problems we realize that there are conflicts. Often these are monetary conflicts. Sustainable alternatives can be a lot more expensive. And while we might do our part and choose the sustainable option, there are many people who don't.

If we found ways to combine personal gain and climate protection it would become a lot easier to make the right decision. 

Solar power investments can offer both. Renewable energy lowers the need for fossil energy and therefore reduces emissions of greenhouse gases. They can also be a viable investment opportunity, especially since the german government guarantees a fixed compensation for solar energy fed into the grid.

This project aims to identify green investment opportunities by finding locations for private solar power systems. It was created during a TechLabs semester.

Results:

The result of the project is the website INERGY. INERGY takes user input, mainly a region or city, and analyses that region for suitable locations. The analysis is then displayed on a map and additional plots.

If available the requested results are loaded from the server. Otherwise the analysis is done in realtime. During the analysis the user keeps getting updated on the steps done.
For the output there are two available options. One can choose between seeing the results for the highest possible energy output or the maximum return on investment. That way it is really easy to see how much positive impact an investment can have for the environment and for the personal gain.

INERGY uses three different data bases, takes 8 weather parameters plus some topographical data into account. It simulates the course of the sun relative to each specific location in the analysis and then chooses the best out of 25 different combinations for the tilt and alignment of the solar power system.
When trying to find the optimum it also references the typical consumption profile of a german household. Using generated electricity is a lot more worthwile than feeding it into the grid. By comparing energy output and energy need at different times of the day this can also be accounted for.

TechLabs Semester:

TechLabs is a global non-profit aiming too teach practical data science skills and more. The organization's courses take about half a year and are split into a learning and a project phase. During the project phase the participants create their own project to apply the learned skills. During the project phase the work is typically done in small teams. My teammates left the project early because of private reasons but I kept going. INERGY is how I chose to test and improve my proficiency in data science.

About the journey:

I had a hard time finding an idea that seemed doable and interesting, I just knew that I would like to combine sustainability and investments. Luckily we had an ideation workshop a few weeks prior to the project kickoff. Another attendee, Gabriel, proposed the idea of finding locations for renewable energy and calculating additional financial data. This idea fit my goals and I ran with it. After my team split up I actually ended up joining Gabriel's project team but still kept working on INERGY. (The results of the other project can be found here: [Insert Link]) So the idea was found.

At the start, still as a team, we began looking for available data. When my team dissolved shortly after I shifted the approach. I tried to pinpoint the major requirements of the project before proceeding:

1. Overview of suitable locations: At the ideation workshop Gabriel also proposed creating a map with the results. Since I also wanted to compare locations it only made sense to keep that.
2. Creating a realistic model: While it is not at all necessary to create something realistic to start out with, it still is a good idea to strive for a representative model.
3. Optimizing for financial return: If the model can generate results that simplify investment decisions it can be part of a greener future. Otherwise maximizing energy output might be a hobby for some but simply relevant for the majority of people.
4. Accessibility: For people to use the tool it needs to be easy to use for non-technical people. A tool only usable by experts could only lead to a few newbuilt power systems. A small number of system would only have a negligible effect on climate protection. This requirement was pointed out by Anastasia Gonotskaya, Head of Data Product at Redstone, at one TechLabs event.
